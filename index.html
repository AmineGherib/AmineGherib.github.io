							Harambe, Greatest Ape
						</p>
						<p>
							When I look past these bars of fate,<br>
							And see your stature laying there,<br>
							With shoulders proud and chest so great,<br>
							And strong hands full of furry hair.
						</p>
						<p>
							And when I see your eyes so pure<br>
							Like sparkling stars lighting the night,<br>
							Which guided me so I'd endure,<br>
							But now are quickly losing might,
						</p>
						<p>
							I wonder, Is it fate that those of purest heart,<br>
							Must leave us all before their time, <br>
							And furry fingers, strongest palms<br>
							May no more hold these hands of mine?
						</p>
						<p>
							And yet I know there is no need,<br>
							For I to go and be alarmbe,<br>
							The strongest ape remebered be,<br>
							With our dicks out for Harambe.

							Harambe, he enjoyed his life,<br>
							had nothing much to do.<br>
							He sat around and ate all day<br>
							in the Cincinnati Zoo.
						</p>
						<p>
							Born in Texas in ninety-nine,<br>
							to Ohio then he went.<br>
							He only lived there sixteen months,<br>
							before his life was spent.
						</p>
						<p>
							He was a massive silver back,<br>
							largest gorillas known.<br>
							He led and supervised his troop<br>
							like a king upon a throne.
						</p>
						<p>
							Was destined to become a dad<br>
							when he had grown some more.<br>
							Mara and Chewie were his girls;<br>
							both of them he did adore.
						</p>
						<p>
							One day there was a little boy,<br>
							who tried to get quite near.<br>
							He fell into Harambe's cage<br>
							and the folks began to fear.
						</p>
						<p>
							He tried to save the boy that day.<br>
							Confused with all the din,<br>
							perhaps he was somewhat too rough<br>
							and thought that the boy was kin.
						</p>
						<p>
							That little boy was standing there<br>
							when they shot Harambe dead.<br>
							He knew not what was happening,<br>
							he was not feeling dread.
						</p>
						<p>
							The moral of this sad, sad tale<br>
							is don't get in a cage,<br>
							neither man nor 'savage' beast,<br>
							you'll both feel mankind's rage.

							A beautiful gentle creature, was murdered yesterday;<br>

							By the society that had captured him, from his home and stole him way!<br>

							They gave him the Swahili name “Harambe”, it means, “go forward at all times”;<br>

							So sad his keepers all were “backwards”, and committed a senseless crime!<br>

							They brought him to America, and put him in a zoo;<br>

							To live his life in captivity, with very little he had do!<br>

							He missed his world in Africa, but he did the best that he ever could;<br>

							To adapt and live within the cage, that mankind said he should!<br>

							He grew into a great large male, with silver down his back;<br>

							A banana was the only thing, that Harambe had ever attacked!<br>

							For one decade plus seven years, he put on quite a show;

							For all the people that visited him, when to the zoo is where they’d go!<br>

							But yesterday his time ran out, for a little boy jumped in;<br>

							Harambe came right to his aid, until a rescue could begin!<br>

							But his keepers misconstrued this, and they filled him full of lead;<br>

							He threw the boy one last sweet kiss, before they then pronounced him dead
